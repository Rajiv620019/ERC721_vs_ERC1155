# ERC721_vs_ERC1155

ERC-721 and ERC-1155 are both standards for creating and managing non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain, but they have some key differences in terms of functionality and use cases.

## ERC-721:

ðŸ‘‰ Individual Tokens: Each token created using the ERC-721 standard is unique and separate from all other tokens. This means that each NFT has its own distinct          smart contract and blockchain entry.

ðŸ‘‰ Single Token Type: ERC-721 is designed for single, unique items. It is commonly used for representing digital art, collectibles, and other unique assets. Each         token within an ERC-721 contract is treated as a separate entity with its own properties and metadata.

ðŸ‘‰ Ownership and Transfers: ERC-721 tokens are easily transferable between different addresses, but each transfer involves a separate transaction. Ownership of an 
    ERC-721 token can only be held by one address at a time.

Use Cases: ERC-721 tokens are well-suited for representing one-of-a-kind or individually distinct assets, where uniqueness and scarcity are important, such as rare art pieces, unique collectibles, and unique in-game items.
